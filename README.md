# Getting started

## Set up the database
To create the database run [this script](https://github.com/tallner/mySQL_movieJava/blob/main/mysql_scripts/createDefaultDB.bat) in the cmd prompt.  
Before you run it you need to have a mySQL database running on your local machine.   
  
Make sure to modify following in the scriptfile:  
* mySQLpath - this is the path to the mysql.exe file in your system
* myPW - the password to your database
* myUS - your username to your database

If you want to run other SQL query files than [sqlfiles](https://github.com/tallner/mySQL_movieJava/tree/main/mysql_scripts/sqlfiles) then you also need to change the filepath, mySQLfilePath, and filenames in the bat file [createDefault.bat](https://github.com/tallner/mySQL_movieJava/blob/main/mysql_scripts/createDefaultDB.bat)


## Run the JAVA application
Start the application in for example Eclipse
